        <h1>How to play Pig 2 dice game</h1>
        <p>
          Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in
          1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they
          wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their
          gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
        </p>
        <p>Gameplay</p>
        <div>
          <p>
            Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is
            rolled or the player decides to "hold":
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the
              next player's turn.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn
              total and the player's turn continues.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
              score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
          <p>
            For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of
            5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.
            Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but
            chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn
            without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence
            4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total
            of 23 points to her score.
